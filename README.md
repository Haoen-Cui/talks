# About

This repository holds information on talks I've given at various places. 

- Many are pretty low-key
- Some are more formal than others

Each directory should contain at least the presentation itself. Most of the time, there are other supporting materials as well. 

If you have any suggestions or comments, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Haoen-Cui/talks/issues) publicly or directly contact me in private.
