# Summability

> In mathematical analysis, a summability method is an alternative formulation of convergence of a series which is divergent in the conventional sense.

In this talk, we present a few _summability_ methods that are not commonly covered in undergraduate analysis courses and look at a few divergent series that are commonly discussed. (Spoiler: they become _summable_ under the new methods.)

This talk was given at `Uptake Math Club` around the time when British mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah claimed that he has solved the Riemann hypothesis. Therefore, a brief intro to Riemann zeta function is also covered at the end.
